# reg_lond_pop
Just a couple of different approaches to using non-linear regression to analyze the London population (based only on time). So far only utilizes a quadratic regression using the SciPy curve_fit tool, as well as also training a separate quadratic model using NumPy's polyfit. This was something I tried a while ago when I was just starting to learn about Machine Learning techniques.
