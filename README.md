# reg_lond_pop
Just a couple of different approaches to using non-linear regression to analyze the London population (based only on time). So far only utilizes a quadratic regression using the SciPy curve_fit tool, as well as also training a separate quadratic model using NumPy's polyfit. The data seems to follow a parabolic pattern though other options will certainly be explored. Just a simple example of regression that I wrote while becoming familiar with the various machine learning tools for python. The various metrics I use seem not to have much variance between the two methods, due to the fact that I used the same train/test sets for both models, though small differences are often present. I have uploaded the plots (which I plotted using matplotlib) of the data and y_hat(predicted values) of the data and models. I have also included the .csv file from which I took the data using pandas.
